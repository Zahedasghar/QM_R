### Basics of quantitative investigation,Research Design
--

### Simply focussing statistics and techniques:  Miss the forest for the trees 
--

### Introduction to Data and exploring it with R
--

###  thinking clearly with data is very important ,once thinking is focused, techniques will follow 
--

### Learning R for making sense of data based case studies
--

#### UN Voting data, Punjab Tax data (Messy vs tidy), WHO, Gapminder, nycflights data

## All relevant materials are at http://.....
## Download Data.zip into your WD to follow along with exercises.
## Open the R script in RStudio.

Why R?
Free
Flexible
Failsafe & future-proof (sort of)
---
What can R do for you?
R is a popular language & platform for data science & statistical computing. It is:

open source
expanding (increasing capabilities through add-ons)
able to open almost any data format
able to scrape data from the web
a decent tool for data wrangling
popular in industry & academia
pretty old ("born" 1976...)
---
But R also:
is a slightly awkward language for those with programming experience
has a steep learning curve
requires a willingness to write code and use scripts (cf. Tableau & co.)
is less general than Python (but a bit easier to use for advanced statistical computing)
---

Why R in a Social Science, Humanities and Public Policy setting?
R is very versatile; it can be used in a variety of settings (cf. specialized tools for specific purposes)
R is open source and free

---
# How might you use R?
Create dataviz for teaching
Introduce as a tool for students
Your own research
--
## Two use cases today

Analyze economic & demographic data
Import data into R
Clean & process the data
Create visualizations

--
Analyze social network data
Create and import network data
Create network visualizations & measures

---
# Caveat emptor!
The two examples are fairly involved
If you're new to R and/or coding, this may look like overload- But! This is a good starting point for you.
Everything I'm doing you'll be able to reproduce on your own

Everything I'm doing you'll be able to reproduce on your own

Things I won't be able to show:

Intro to the R language itself
We don't have the time, so learn by tweaking my code
RMarkdown (using R to produce complete documents or slides)
Text analysis in R
R offers powerful packages! Links at the end of this workshop

# R is a calculator
```{r}
1 + 1
```
# R is an object-based language

```{r}
students <- 16
papers <- 3
papers_to_grade <- students * papers
papers_to_grade
```
---

#Try for yourself!
How many papers would you have to grade if you were teaching two instead of one section?

```{r}
students <- 16
papers <- 3
classes <- 2
papers_to_grade <- students * papers * classes
papers_to_grade
```

# R can be extended by using one of 12,621 packages

See (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/)

# Install packages once, load them each time
For data input/output:
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
help(package = "tidyverse")
```

```{r}

#glimpse(cia)
#View(cia)
```

# Life expectancy
```{r}
