## Observartional Studies 

### Controlled studies not the same as observational

-   [**observationsl studies: its the subjects who assign themselves to different groups: the investigator watch just what happens**]{.hi}

### [Controlled : investigator decides who to be in control group and who to will be in treatment group] {.purple}

## Control has two senses 

### [a control is a subject who did not get the treatment:]{.hi}

### [a controlled experiment is a study where the investigators decides who will be in the treatment group and who will not.]{.hi}

### Smoking and lungs cancer

### Main issue: [was the control group really similar to the treatment group- apart from the exposure of interest?]{.hi}

### Statisticians talk about controlling for confounding factors in an observational studies. This is a third word of the use control.

## Examples 

### [The Clofibrate trial]{.hi-purple}

### Pellagara

### [Cervical cancer and cicumcision]{.hi-purple}

### Ultrasound and low birthweight

### [The Samaritan and suicide]{.hi-purple}
