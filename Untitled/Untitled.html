# Learning Goals

## Learning Goals for Probability and Probability Distribution

- Demonstrate understanding of random variables (discrete or continuous)

- Demonstrate understanding of characteristics of binomial and normal distributions.

- Calculate accurate probabilities of discrete or continuous random variables and interpret them in a variety of settings: normal distribution and binomial distribution.

- Calculate the standardized value (or `\(z\)`-score).

---

## Random Variables

- A **random variable**, usually written `\(X\)`, is a variable whose values are numerical quantities of possible outcomes a random experiment.

- A **discrete random variable** takes on only a finite or countable number of distinct values.

  **Example:** Roll a fair dice, the number of dots on the top faces is a discrete random variables takes on the possible values: 1, 2, 3, ,4, 5, 6.

- A **continuous random variable** takes on values which form an interval of numbers.

  **Example:** The height of an adult which takes on values in a certain interval.

---

## Probability Distributions (1/2)

- The **probability distribution** of a discrete random variable `\(X\)` can be characterized a list of all possible values `\(x\)` together with probabilities `\(P(x)\)`.

- A random variable `\(X\)` (discrete and continuous) always has a **cumulative distribution function**: `\(F_X(x)=P(X\leq x)\)` (= `\(\sum_{x_i\leq x} P(x_i)\)` if `\(X\)` is discrete).

- Recall basic rules of probability:
  - `\(0\leq P(X=x)\leq 1\)`.
  - the sum of all the probabilities is 1, that is `\(P(X\leq x_{max})=1\)`.
  - In particular, `\(0\leq F_X(x)\leq 1\)`.

- The probability distribution can be recovered from its cumulative distribution function.

---

## Probability Distributions (2/2)

- **Example:** Let `\(X\)` be the number of heads that are observed when tossing two fair coins. The probability distribution can be characterized by the following table:
.center[
| `\(X\)`   | 0   | 1   | 2   |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| `\(P(X)\)` |0.25 | 0.5 | 0.25|
]

  From the table, we may find the following cumulative distributions:
  `$$P(X\leq 1)=P(X=0)+P(X=1)=0.25+0.5=0.75.$$`
  `$$P(X\leq 2)= P(X=0)+P(X=1)+P(X=2)=0.25+0.5+0.25=1.$$`
  We may also recover probability distributions from the cumulative distribution, e.g.
  `$$P(X=2)=P(X\leq 2)-P(X\leq 1).$$`

---

## Mean and Standard Deviation of a Discrete Random Variable (1/3)

- The **mean** `\(\mu\)` (also called the **expected value** `\(E(X)\)`) of a discrete random variable `\(X\)` is the number `$$\mu= E(X)=\sum xP(x).$$`

- The **variance** `\(\sigma^2\)` of a discrete random variable `\(X\)` is the number `$$\sigma^2=\sum (x-\mu)^2P(X).$$`

- The **standard deviation** `\(\sigma\)` of a discrete random variable `\(X\)` is the square root of its variance: `$$\sigma=\sqrt{\sum (x-\mu)^2P(X)}.$$`

---

## Mean and Standard Deviation of a Discrete Random Variable (2/3)

- **Example:** One thousand raffle tickets are sold for $2 each. Each has an equal chance of winning. First prize is $500, second prize is $300, and third prize is $100. Find the expected value of gain, and interpret its meaning.

  **Solution:** Let `\(X\)` denote the net gain from purchasing one ticket. The probability distribution for `\(X\)` is
.center[
| `\(X\)`    | 498    | 298    | 98     | -2       |
|------|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| `\(P(X)\)` | `\(\frac{1}{1000}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{1000}\)` | `\(\frac{1}{1000}\)` | `\(\frac{997}{1000}\)` |
]

  The expected gain is `$$E(X)= 498\cdot \frac{1}{1000}+ 298\cdot\frac{1}{1000}+98\cdot \frac{1}{1000}+(-2)\cdot \frac{997}{1000}=-1.1,$$` which means that when buying one ticket, the buyer may expect a loss of $1.1.

## Mean and Standard Deviation of a Discrete Random Variable (3/3)

- **Example:** The wait times (rounded to multiples of 5) in the cafeteria at a Community College has the following probability distribution. Find the standard deviation.
.center[
| `\(X\)` (minutes) | 5        | 10       | 15      | 20       | 25       |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `\(P(X)\)`             | 0.13 | 0.25 | 0.31 | 0.21 | 0.1 |
]

  **Solution:** The mean of the distribution is $$ \mu= 5\cdot 0.13 +10\cdot 0.25+15\cdot 0.31+20\cdot 0.21 + 25\cdot 0.1 = 14.5.$$ The standard deviation is then `$$\scriptstyle \sigma=\sqrt{(5-14.5)^2\cdot 0.13 +(10-14.5)^2\cdot 0.25+(15-14.5)^2\cdot 0.31+(20-14.5)^2\cdot 0.21 + (25-14.5)^2\cdot 0.1}\approx 5.9.$$`

---

## Binomial Distribution (1/5)

- A **binomial experiment** is a probability experiment satisfying:

  1. The experiment has a fixed number `\(n\)` of independent trials.
  2. Each trial has only two possible outcomes: a success (S) or a failure (F).
  3. The probability `\(p\)` of a success is the same for each trial.

- The discrete random variable `\(X\)` counting the number of successes in the `\(n\)` trials is the **binomial random variable**. We say `\(X\)` has a **binomial distribution** with parameters `\(n\)` and `\(p\)` and write it as `\(X\sim B(n, p)\)`.

- For `\(X\sim B(n, p)\)`, the **probability of getting exactly `\(x\)` successes in `\(n\)` trials** is `$$P(X=x)=B(x,n,p)={_n C_x} p^x(1-p)^{n-x}=\frac{n!}{(n-x)!x!}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}.$$`

- The notation `\(n!=n(n-1)\cdots 1\)` is read as `\(n\)` factorial. We set `\(0!=1.\)`

- The notation `\({_n C_x}=\frac{n!}{(n-x)!x!}\)` is read as `\(n\)` choose `\(x\)`, which is the number of ways to choose `\(x\)` objects from a set of `\(n\)` objects.

---

## Binomial Distribution (2/5)

- **Example:** A card is selected from a standard deck and replaced. This experiment is repeated a total of `\(5\)` times.
  - Find the probability of selecting exactly `\(3\)` clubs.
  - Find the probability of getting at least `\(3\)` clubs.
  
  **Solution:** This is a binomial experiment. The number to total trial is `\(n=5\)`. The number of success is `\(3\)`. The chance of a success is `\(p=\frac{13}{52}=\frac14\)`. Apply the binomial probability formula, we have
  `$$P(X=3)=\frac{5!}{3!2!} \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^3\left(\frac34\right)^2=10\cdot\frac{9}{4^5}\approx 0.088.$$`

  To probability of getting at least `\(3\)` club is
  `$$P(X\geq 3) =1-P(X\leq 2)=1-(P(0)+P(1)+P(2))\approx 1-0.8965=0.1035.$$`

---

## Binomial Distribution (3/5)
  
  **Solution:(continued)**
  To calculate `\(P(X\leq 2)\)`, we may also use the binomial distribution table or the Excel function `BINOM.DIST()`.

  **Method 1:** As `\(n=5\)` and `\(p=0.25\)`, we use the following portion of the cumulative binomial distribution table.
  .center[Binomial Probability Table *n=5*

| n    | x    | 0.1    | 0.15   | 0.2    | 0.25   | 0.3    | 0.35   | 0.4    |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 5    | 0    | 0.5905 | 0.4437 | 0.3277 | .red[0.2373] | 0.1681 | 0.116  | 0.0778 |
| 5    | 1    | 0.3281 | 0.3915 | 0.4096 | .red[0.3955] | 0.3602 | 0.3124 | 0.2592 |
| 5    | 2    | 0.0729 | 0.1382 | 0.2048 | .red[0.2637] | 0.3087 | 0.3364 | 0.3456 |
| 5    | 3    | 0.0081 | 0.0244 | 0.0512 | 0.0879 | 0.1323 | 0.1811 | 0.2304 |
  ]
  
  `\(P(X\le 2) \approx 0.2373+0.3955+0.2637= 0.8965.\)`

  **Method 2:** In Excel, `\(P(X\le 2)\)` `=BINOM.DIST(2,5,0.25,TRUE)` `\(\approx 0.8965\)`.

???
In a calculator, use `binompdf(n, p, x)` for `\(P(X=x)\)` and `binomcdf(n, p, x)` for `\(P(X\leq x)\)`.

---

## Binomial Distribution (4/5)

- The mean of a binomial distribution of `\(n\)` trials is `$$\mu =\sum xP(x)=\sum x\cdot \dfrac{n!}{(n-x)!x!}p^x(1-p)^{n-x} = np.$$`

- The variance of a binomial distribution of `\(n\)` trials is `$$\sigma^2 =\sum (x-np)^2P(x)=\sum x^2P(x)-(np)^2=np(1-p).$$`  

- The variance of a binomial distribution of `\(n\)` trials is `$$\sigma=\sqrt{np(1-p)}.$$`

- We consider an event `\(E\)` **unusual** if the probability `\(P(E)\leq 5\%\)`.

---

## Binomial Distribution (5/5)

- **Example:** The probability that an egg in a retail package is cracked or broken is 0.02.
  - Find the average number of cracked or broken eggs in a one dozen carton.
  - Find the standard deviation. Is getting at least two broken eggs unusual?

  **Solution:** Since there are 12 eggs and the chance of getting a cracked egg is 0.02, the average number of cracked is
  `$$\mu =np=12\cdot 0.02=0.24.$$`
  
  The standard deviation is
  `$$\sigma=\sqrt{12\cdot 0.02\cdot(1-0.02)}\approx 0.4850.$$`

  Recall the Empirical rule: 95% data are within 2 standard deviation away from the mean. Since `\(2&gt;0.24+2\cdot 0.4850\)`, the chance of getting at least two cracked eggs is less than 5%, which is considered as unusual.

---

## Continuous Probability Distribution

- The probability distribution of a continuous random variable `\(X\)` is characterized by its **probability density function** `\(f(X)\)` satisfying that the probability `\(P(a\leq X\leq b)\)` equals the area above the interval `\([a, b]\)` but under the graph of the function `\(f(X)\)`.

.center[

&lt;img src="Untitled_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="360" /&gt;
&lt;img src="Untitled_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="360" /&gt;

]

- Recall that the probability `\(P(X\le b)\)` is a cumulative probability.

- By the addition rule of probability, we have `\(P(a\le X\le b)=P(X\le b)-P(X\le a)\)` and `\(P(X\ge b)=1-P(X\le b)\)`

- As a line segment has no area, we have `\(P(X\le a)=P(X&lt; a)\)` as well as `\(P(X\ge b)=P(X&gt;b)\)`

---

## Normal Distribution (1/5)

- A **normal distribution** has a **density function** `\(f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}},\)`
where `\(\mu\)` is the mean, `\(\sigma\)` is the standard deviation, `\(\pi\approx 3.14159\)` and `\(e\approx 2.71828\)`. The graph of `\(f\)` is called a **normal curve**.

- We write `\(X\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)\)` for a normal random variable `\(X\)` with the mean `\(\mu\)` and the standard deviation `\(\sigma\)`.

- A normal distribution has the following properties:
  - *The mean, median, and mode are equal*.
  - The normal curve is *bell shaped and symmetric* with respect to the mean.
  - The *total area* under the curve and above the `\(x\)`-axis is `\(1\)`.
  - The normal curve *approaches, but never touches, the `\(x\)`-axis* as `\(x\)` goes to `\(\pm\infty\)`.
  - Between `\(\mu-\sigma\)` and `\(\mu+\sigma\)`, the graph *curves downward*. On the left side of `\(\mu-\sigma\)` or the right side of `\(\mu+\sigma\)`, the graph *curves upward*.  A point at which the curve changes the direction of curving is called an **inflection point**.

## Normal Distribution (3/5)

- **Example:** Suppose that foot length of a randomly chosen adult male is a normal random variable with mean `\(\mu=11\)` and standard deviation `\(\sigma=1.5\)`.
  - How likely is a male's foot length to be smaller than 9.5 inches
  - How likely is a male's foot length to be bigger than 8 inches

  **Solution:** Let's first sketch the normal curve.
.center[


&lt;img src="Untitled_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="432" /&gt;
] 
  Note that `\(9.5=11-1.5=\mu-\sigma\)`. The probability `$$\scriptstyle P(X&lt;9.5)=\frac12(1-P(9.5&lt;X&lt;12.5))\approx\frac12(1-0.683)=0.1585.$$`
  Note that `\(8=11-2\cdot 1.5=\mu-2\sigma\)`. The probability `$$\scriptstyle P(X&gt;8)=(1-P(X&lt;8))=1-(0.5-0.5\cdot P(8&lt;X&lt;14))=0.5+0.5\cdot 0.954=0.977.$$`

---

## Normal Distribution (4/5)

- A normal distribution is called a **standard normal distribution** if the mean is `\(\mu=0\)` and the standard deviation is `\(\sigma=1\)`.

- A random normal variable can be **standardized** by the following formula
  `$$z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}.$$`
  We call the value `\(z\)` the ** `\(Z\)`-score** of `\(x\)`.

- In Excel, the `\(Z\)`-score of `\(x\)` can be calculated by the function `STANDARDIZE()`.
  
- Standardization does not change probability:
  `$$P(a&lt;X&lt;b)=P\left(\frac{a-\mu}{\sigma}&lt; Z &lt; \frac{b-\mu}{\sigma}\right).$$`

- The probability `\(P(X&lt; x)\)` can be calculated by the function `NORM.DIST()` or the standard normal distribution table.

---

## Normal Distribution (5/5)

- **Example:** The heights of 25-year-old women in a certain region are approximately normally distributed with mean 62 inches and standard deviation 4 inches. Find the probability that a randomly selected 25-year-old woman is nore than 67 inches tall.

 **Solution:** Let's first sketch the normal curve.
.pull-left[

&lt;img src="Untitled_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="432" /&gt;
]
.pull-right[.center[Area to the left of the Z-score]

| Z    | 0.04   | 0.05   | 0.06   |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1.2  | 0.8925 | .red[0.8944] | 0.8962 |
]
&lt;br&gt;
The probaiblity is `\(P(X&gt;67)=1-P(X&lt;67)\)`. To calculate `\(P(X&lt;67)\)`:
&lt;br&gt;
  **Method 1:** Use the standard normal distribution table: First find the `\(Z\)`-score: `\(z=\frac{67-62}{4}=1.25\)`; Then `\(P(Z&lt;1.25)\approx 0.8944\)` is the value located in the row of 1.2 (first two digits of the `\(z\)`-score) and the column 0.05 (the last digit of the `\(z\)`-score).
&lt;br&gt;
  **Method 2:** Use Excel:  function `NORM.DIST()`: `\(P(X&lt;67)=\)` `NORM.DIST(67, 62, 4, TRUE)` `\(\approx 0.8944\)`.
  &lt;br&gt;
  Then `\(P(X&gt;67)\approx 1-0.8944=0.1056\)`.

## Excel Functions for Binomial and Normal Distributions

- Let `\(X\)` be a binomial random variable with parameters `\(n\)` and `\(p\)`, that is `\(X\sim B(n, p)\)`. In Excel, `\(P(X=x)\)` is given by `BINORM.DIST(x, n, p, FALSE)` and `\(P(X\le x)\)` is given by `BINORM.DIST(x, n, p, true)`. You may click input function `\(f_x\)` and then search `binorm` to find the function.

- Let `\(Z\)` be a standard normal random varaible. In Excel, `\(P(Z&lt;z)\)` is given by `NORM.S.DIST(z, TRUE)`.

- Let `\(X\)` be a normal random variable with mean `\(\mu\)` and standard deviation `\(\sigma\)`, that is `\(X\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)\)`. In Excel, `\(P(X&lt;x)\)` is given by `NORM.DIST(x, mu, sigma, TRUE)`.

- When a cumulative probability `\(p=P(X&lt;x)\)` of a normal random variable `\(X\)` is given, we can find `\(x\)` using `NORM.INV(p, mu, sigma)`.

- When a cumulative probability `\(p=P(Z&lt;z)\)` of a standard normal random variable `\(Z\)` is given, we can find `\(z\)` using `NORM.S.INV(p)`.
