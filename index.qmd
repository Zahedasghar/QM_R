## Course Overview

This course is designed to introduce [students to focus on research design]{.yellow}, [thinking clearly with data]{.yellow} and learn to analyze data apply techniques through computer-based exercises . Philosophy of the course will be to enable students doing exploratory data analytics by mastering concepts through computer assisted tools. [Main software for the course will be R]{.yellow}, STATA do files will also be provided for many of the topics. This course will

-   Emphasis on understanding theory through applications and problem solving, rather than mathematical theorems and complex proofs.

-   Working as a learning community to improve data analytics skills necessary in analyzing data.

## Books for the course

-   Following books will be followed for this course but mainly we shall follow **OpenIntro Statistics** a widely used source at leading universities of the globa:

-   [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

-   [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/)

-   [Thinking Clearly with Data](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691214368/thinking-clearly-with-data)

## Course Objectives

Labs and assignments will be based on real-world data and problems in a wide range of fields in social sciences and humanities, including psychology, sociology, education, and public health. The basics of R and R Markdown will also be covered in the course.


## Why this course

-   This course is not a routine statistics learning course.

-   This course is about critical reasoning with data and discussion about evidence based decisioin making.

-   Differentiating : opinion, anecdotes and hard core evidence

-   All slides, codes, notes, data and all related data sets will be provided to all the participants.

-   Learning how to create beautiful presentations, documents and writing research papers using R.

-   Course contents and class quiz based on highly upto date followed in Harvard University, University of Berkeley, Duke among others.

    One can't learn all everything in five weeks tim but objective is enabling beginers to move on data analytics learning path while taking professionals to next ladder from their current level of knowledge.

## Who should join

-   Anyone can join this course but obviously those who are with English, History or other humanities background will have to work very hard.

-   Researchers, practitioners, data journalists, data analysts and those who want to start their journey for learning data analytics.

## Data Science

-   [You go into data analysis with the tools you know, not the tools you need]{.hi}

-   The next 2-3 weeks are all about giving you the tools you need

    -   Admittedly, a bit before you know what you need them *for*

-   We will extend them as we learn specific models

## R

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Free** and **open source**

-   A very large community

    -   Written by statisticians for statistics
    -   Most packages are written for `R` first

-   Can handle virtually any data format

-   Makes replication easy

-   Can integrate into documents (with `Quarto`)

-   R is a *language* so it can do *everything*

    -   A good stepping stone to learning other languages like *Python*

## Excel (or Stata) Can't Do This

::: panel-tabset
## Code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = gapminder, 
       aes(x = gdpPercap,
           y = lifeExp,
           color = continent))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
	scale_x_log10(breaks=c(1000,10000, 100000),
	              label=scales::dollar)+
	labs(x = "GDP/Capita",
	     y = "Life Expectancy (Years)")+
  facet_wrap(~continent)+
  guides(color = F)+
  theme_light()
```

## Output

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
ggplot(data = gapminder, 
       aes(x = gdpPercap,
           y = lifeExp,
           color = continent))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
	scale_x_log10(breaks=c(1000,10000, 100000),
	              label=scales::dollar)+
	labs(x = "GDP/Capita",
	     y = "Life Expectancy (Years)")+
  facet_wrap(~continent)+
  guides(color = F)+
  theme_light()
```

## Or This

::: panel-tabset
### Input

The average GDP per capita is `` ` r dollar(mean(gapminder$gdpPercap)) ` `` with a standard deviation of `` ` r dollar(sd(gapminder$gdpPercap)) ` ``.

### Output

The average GDP per capita is `r dollar(mean(gapminder$gdpPercap))` with a standard deviation of `r dollar(sd(gapminder$gdpPercap))`.
